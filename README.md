# xml-processes

edifact - copy contains all code for questions.
Each question has its own folder in ABM Developer Test/
Question 3 is within this folder as a console program as well as inside WebApplication1.

The reason for question 3 been in two places is I couldn't get postman to work with my dev env for some reason. I've included some xml files for runing the program. I used debug to run the programs so the files need to be within debug folder for them to work/be found.
